## TiDev Roadmap

Below are the specific goals TiDev, Inc is working towards in accordance with our [Organization Goals](https://github.com/tidev/organization-docs/blob/main/ORGANIZATION_GOALS.md).

For the TiDev Website:

 1.  **Developer directory.** This means a place where developers that actively contribute to the TiDev project can list themselves as "for hire" by businesses looking for mobile developer talent. Should include an ability to link to their social media profiles, business website, and previous Titanium projects they've built.
 2.  **Corporate sponsor promotion.** This means prominent placement of corporation logos and websites that actively fund the TiDev project on the TiDev website as a way for them to build community good will and market themselves to our developer community.
 3.  **Actively Supported Titanium Modules.** This means a searchable directory on our website where we keep a published list of ACTIVELY SUPPORTED modules for Titanium. One place to look that doesn't involve lots of Googling for our developer community.
 4. **Solid Getting Started / On-Boarding Manual.** This means articles, videos, and walk-throughs that make it as easy as possible to get new developers into the platform. React Native does this really well using playgrounds, etc, online. We're aiming for, at minimum, parity with that while also making the experience even better if possible.


For the Titanium SDK:

 1. **Stay on top of iOS and Android SDK updates.** This means whatever open bugs we have filed against the SDK repository as tickets that cause crashing, appstore submission issues, or security problems are addressed quickly as top priority.
 2. **New Release Management.** This means figuring out how SDK releases will be handled/distributed in a post-Axway maintained world.
 3. **Better interoperability with NPM modules.** This means making the NPM tool chain and modules 1st class citizens of our platform where things always "just work" similar to the Electron and React ecosystems. Adding polyfills, etc, where required to the core Titanium SDK.
 4. **Improve the SDK Documentation.** This means documenting the most complicated parts of the Titanium SDK in a way where it's easier for new native devs to jump in and contribute to the code base. Especially in areas such as the bridge and Javascript core.
 5. **Titanium Doctor.** This means working in the direction of a "Titanium Doctor" module that can help newbies and pros alike quickly diagnose issues with their environment. Instead of cryptic node errors, Xcode errors, etc that require constant involvement from the native developers.

For Titanium Modules:

 1. **Identify modules that are critical to the platform.** This means creating a list of modules that absolutely must be supported and actively patched (such as Titanium Firebase). The purpose of this is to ensure that TiDev can step in if needed and organize efforts (read: spend money if needed) to make sure they stay actively maintained going forward.
 2. **Bounty System Development.** This means developing a bounty system for fixing bugs on non-essential modules that are also nice to have in the Titanium ecosystem, and facilitating support of those modules either with capital or volunteer support.
