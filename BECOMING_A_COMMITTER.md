# Becoming a Committer

A committer is someone who has a proven record of significant contributions to TiDev projects by submitting pull requests, reviewing pull requests, writing documentation, participating with the community, and/or donating projects. It's a privilege that must be earned with time and dedication.

## Steps to Become a Committer

1. Sign the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://tidev.io/contribute)
2. Get involved with one or more TiDev projects
3. Get nominated by a current committer

## Committer Approval Process

Once you have been nominated, a vote will be held by the TiDev board and current committers. After the voting window has closed, the majority vote determines if you are granted committer access and to which projects.

There are several levels of committer access based on your contributions:

 * Documentation
 * Modules
 * Tooling (CLI, Node packages, VSCode extension, etc)
 * Titanium SDK

You may be granted committer access to only a single project or in the rare circumstance, all projects.

## Keeping your Commit Access

For security reasons, the TiDev board members may choose to suspend your commit privileges if you have been inactive for longer than 1 year.

Violating the [code of conduct](https://tidev.io/code-of-conduct) may also result in commit access being revoked.

You may voluntarily suspend your commit privileges should you choose.
